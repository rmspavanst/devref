# Just use the journalctl command, as in:

journalctl -u service-name.service

journalctl -xefu service-name.service

# Or, to see only log messages for the current boot:

journalctl -u service-name.service -b

# For things named <something>.service, you can actually just use <something>, as in:

journalctl -u service-name


# systemctl can include the complete output of its status listing, without truncation., by adding the -l flag:

systemctl -l status service-name

## Use journalctl to View Your System's Logs

# View journalctl without PagingPermalink To send your logs to standard output and avoid paging them, use the --no-pager option:

journalctl --no-pager

# Itâ€™s not recommended that you do this without first filtering down the number of logs shown.

journalctl -u service-name.service

# Show Logs within a Time RangePermalink Use the --since option to show logs after a specified date and time:

journalctl --since "2018-08-30 14:10:10"

# Use the --until option to show logs up to a specified date and time:

journalctl --until "2018-09-02 12:05:50"

# Combine these to show logs between the two times:

journalctl --since "2018-08-30 14:10:10" --until "2018-09-02 12:05:50"
