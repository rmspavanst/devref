==================================================================

Tuned:
=======
Tuned is a Linux feature that monitors a system and optimizes its performance under certain workloads. 
Tuned uses profiles to do this. A profile is a set of rules that defines certain system parameters such as disk settings, 
kernel parameters, network optimization settings, and many other aspects of the system.

Profile-based system for static and dynamic tuning of system settings
By default, tuned will not dynamically adjust system settings, Tp modify manually use tuned-adm command line tool.

imp cmd's:
---------------
yum installed tuned -y
tuned-adm list (list all the available profiles)
tuned-adm active (shows which is active profile)
tuned-adm profile <profile_name> (to change active profile to another profile)
tuned-adm recommend (recommend profile for the system)
tuned-adm off
