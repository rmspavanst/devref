Find the line that starts with  Linux and go to the end of the line and type

rd.break
Press Ctrl+x to Enter the rescue mode

#mount -o remount, rw /sysroot or Remount the root filesystem = mount -o remount,rw/
#chroot /sysroot
#passwd
#touch /.autorelabbel
exit
exit

replace 'ro' parameter with 'rw init=/sysroot/bin/sh' or replace "rhgb quiet" with "rd.rbeak enforcing=0" and "mount -o remount, rw /sysroot"
chroot /sysroot/
passwd root
touch /.autorelabel
exit

Question 3:
Assign static IP to your network interface with the following:

Question 4:
Add additional/secondary IPV4 address statically to your current running interface. It should not compromise your existing settings:

nmcli connection modify enp0s3 +ipv4.address "10.0.0.212/24"
nmcli connection reload
systemctl reboot


Question 5:
Add the following secondary IPV6 address statically to your current running interface. Do this in a way that doesn’t compromise your existing settings:

nmcli connection reload
systemctl reboot


Question 6:
Enable IPV4 packet forwarding. This should persist after a reboot.
