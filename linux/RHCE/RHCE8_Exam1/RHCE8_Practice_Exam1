# Task 1 :

Install ansible package on the control node (including any dependencies) and configure the following:
1 - Create a regular user automation with the password of devops. Use this user for all sample exam tasks.
2 - All playbooks and other Ansible configuration that you create for this sample exam should be stored in /home/automation/plays.
3 - Create a configuration file /home/automation/plays/ansible.cfg to meet the following requirements:
The roles path should include /home/automation/plays/roles, as well as any other path that may be required for the course of the sample exam.
The inventory file path is /home/automation/plays/inventory.
Privilege escallation is disabled by default.
Ansible should be able to manage 10 hosts at a single time.
Ansible should connect to all managed nodes using the automation user.
Create an inventory file /home/automation/plays/inventory with the following:
ansible2.hl.local is a member of the proxy host group.
ansible3.hl.local is a member of the webservers host group.
ansible4.hl.local is a member of the webservers host group.
ansible5.hl.local is a member of the database host group

# Task 2 :

Generate an SSH key pair on the control node for the automation user. You can perform this step manually.
Write a script /home/automation/plays/adhoc.sh that uses Ansible ad-hoc commands to achieve the following:
User automation is created on all inventory hosts.
The SSH public key that you just generated is copied to all managed hosts for the automation user.
The automation user has full sudo access on all managed nodes without having to provide a password.
After running the adhoc.sh bash script, you should be able to SSH into all managed hosts using the automation user without a password, as well as a run all privileged commands.

# Solution of Task2

# echo "automation ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/automation
# ssh-keygen 
# vim adhoc.sh 
	#!/bin/bash
    # you can specify the inventory file with -i option 
    ansible all -m user -a "user='automation' comment='User Create by Ansible'" -u root --ask-pass 
    ansible all -m authorized_key -a "user=automation state=present key={{ lookup('file', '/home/automation/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}" -u root --ask-pass
    ansible all -m copy -a "src='/etc/sudoers.d/automation' dest='/etc/sudoers.d/'" -u root --ask-pass

# chmod 755 adhoc.sh 
# ./adhoc.sh


# Task 3 :

Create a playbook /home/automation/plays/motd.yml that runs on all inventory hosts and does the following:
The playbook should replace any existing content of /etc/motd with text. Text depends on the host group.

On hosts in the proxy host group the line should be “Welcome to HAProxy server”.
On hosts in the webserver host group the line should be “Welcome to Apache server”.
On hosts in the database host group the line should be “Welcome to MySQL server”

# Solution of Task3

# mkdir group_vars ; cd group_vars
# echo "message: Welcome to HAProxy server" >> proxy
