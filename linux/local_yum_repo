Need to set up yum repository for locally-mounted DVD on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8:
======================================================================================


Environment:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

Issue:
How to set up yum repository to use locally-mounted DVD with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8
Would like to upgrade server from RHEL 8.x to RHEL 8.y
Have a secure environment that will never be connected to the internet, but still needs to be updated
Way to update the packages on server, with no satellite server and servers disconnected from internet
Offline patches for Red Hat systems
How do I create a local repository in RHEL 8?


Resolution:
=============
Please note: If the system is registered to Red Hat Network, yum can be run with the --noplugins option to prevent it from connecting to RHN. The safer option would be to unregister the system to avoid updating to the latest release.

Mount the downloaded RHEL installation ISO to a directory like /media/rheldvd,

Raw
# mount -o loop <downloaded iso name> /media/rheldvd

Example:
# mount -o loop rhel-server-8.0-x86_64-dvd.iso /media/rheldvd
If you use DVD media, you can mount like below.

Raw
# mount /dev/sr0  /media/rheldvd
Create new repo file like below. There are two repositories in RHEL 8, named BaseOS and AppStream.

Raw
# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/my.repo 
[dvd-BaseOS]
name=DVD for RHEL - BaseOS
baseurl=file:///media/rheldvd/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

[dvd-AppStream]
name=DVD for RHEL - AppStream
baseurl=file:///media/rheldvd/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
As a final step, it might be a good idea to run the command yum clean all once

Raw
# yum clean all
Check whether you can get the packages list from the DVD repositories.

Raw
# yum  --noplugins list
