Required Tools:
================
     -Virtualbox
     -Vagrant
     -Git

What does Vagrant do?
– Create and destroy VMs
– Starts, stops, restarts VMs
– Access to VMs
– Networking and WM settings
– Orchestrates “provisioning” for on-demand setup

step:1- Install Git for Windows
---------------------------------
Download URL: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Then during installation steps, select below settings:

“Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt” with this option you will be able to use Git from both Git Bash and the Windows Command Prompt.
“Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings”
And finish the installation.


Step:2- Install VirtualBox
-----------------------------
For the sake of compatibility and in order to eliminate the version problems please install VirtualBox 5.1.14r112924 (Qt5.6.2) version.

 Downlod Link: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.4/VirtualBox-5.1.4-110228-Win.exe

Then, open VirtualBox and click File -> Preferences -> Extensions click the below icon

And select the extension pack and then click “Install” -> “I Agree” -> “Yes”



Step:3- Install Vagrant:
-------------------------
In order to eliminate compatibility issues, it is better to install Vagrant 1.9.2 version.

 Vagrant Download Link: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.2/vagrant_1.9.2.msi

Install the Vagrant it is very easy to install and then restart your machine.

 After these setting you should do below settings to run Vagrant without any problem:

1) Enable VT-X (Intel Virtualization Technology) in your computer bios settings.

2) Disable Hyper-V on program and features page in the control panel.

Download and Run Ubuntu Desktop (GUI) Vagrant Box on Windows 10
Open Git Bash and type “pwd” it should show your user directory as shown below:

/c/Users/onurb

Then, create a folder as “project” by using “mkdir projects” command.

Then, go to that folder with “cd projects”

Then create a folder for Ubuntu by using “mkdir ubuntu1404-desktop” command.

and go to that folder with “cd ubuntu1404-desktop” command.

After these steps run below commands sequentially:
