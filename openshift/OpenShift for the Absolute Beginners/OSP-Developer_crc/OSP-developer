1. Notes for Hosted OpenShift users
2. Hosted OpenShift Users and Projects

If you are using Hosted OpenShift for this course, there are a couple differences for this projects and users section. You may not be able to follow along with everything, but you should still watch the videos to see how these commands work.

Users:
---------
Your username is your RedHat username. However, Hosted OpenShift does not support username / password login. You'll need to get the token from the web console to log in to Hosted OpenShift.


Projects:
------------
If you try to run oc new-project on Hosted OpenShift, you will get this error from the server:

Error from server (Forbidden): You may not request a new project via this API.

This error comes from a restriction on the Hosted OpenShift environment. Part of the way RedHat manages the free sandbox accounts is by using the project system to limit your resource usage. That means you are restricted to their default projects, <your_user_name>_dev and <your_user_name>_stage.

You can use either one for this course. You'll need to substitute the project name when it comes up in commands. Also, you should run oc delete all --all in between sections to clean up.

You should be able to use oc projects and oc project <your_user_name>_stage to navigate the two projects you do have access to.


Lab: Pods
=========
Instructions


These are the steps you should complete as part of the lab. Labs are open-book. Feel free to examine sources such as the labs project for the course, the cheat sheets, and online documentation to complete these tasks.

In this lab, you will create a custom Pod definition and upload it to OpenShift. This will test your skills in writing and debugging Pod YAML for the OpenShift platform.



First, create a new file under the labs project. The path will be pods/lab-pod.yaml

Copy the pod definition from another source into lab-pod.yaml

Update the MESSAGE environment variable to a custom message. Update the name.

Start a Pod based on lab-pod.yaml on the server

Forward port 8080 from your computer to the running Pod

You can use oc port-forward pod/lab-pod 8080 to do this



Checklist


Once you meet all of these criteria, you have successfully completed the lab. You will need to run the commands yourself in order to grade this lab.



Output from oc get pods contains the pod you uploaded in step 5

Output from oc describe pod/lab-pod has the correct name and MESSAGE environment value

curl localhost:8080 prints the message you entered in step 3


OpenShift 4 DeploymentConfig notes
===================================
This course now supports OpenShift 4 by default. This means that many oc new-app commands use the --as-deployment-config flag. If you try to use this on OpenShift 3, you'll get an error from oc saying that --as-deployment-config is not a valid flag.



If you want to continue in this course using OpenShift 3, you can omit the --as-deployment-config flag from the commands in this course.



How to tell what version of oc you have:

$ oc version
 
# Version 3 will have a line like this
oc v3.11.0+0cbc58b
 
# Version 4 will have a line like this
Client Version: 4.6.1


Here's the difference in the command between versions

# Version 3 to 4.4
$ oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
 
# Version 4.5+
$ oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config
