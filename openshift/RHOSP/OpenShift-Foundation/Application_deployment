# Question 1
Which of the following is a true statement about the role of deployment configurations?
Deployment configurations have triggers that drive automated deployments in response to events
Deployment configurations allow rollbacks to a previous version, either manually or automatically in case of deployment failure
Deployment configurations allow manual replication scaling and autoscaling
All of the above #

# Question 2
There is no application downtime when using the "Recreate" deployment strategy.
TRUE
FALSE #

# Question 3
Which of the following is NOT a deployment strategy?
Recreate
Rolling
Pipeline #
Custom

# Question 4
Which of the following is NOT a typical step in a CI/CD workflow?
The CI server polls the source code repository for changes
The developer manually builds code and copies compiled binaries to test the environment #
The CI server generates feedback by emailing the team members about the build results
If the build is successful, a deployment is made to a production clone server 

# Question 5
Which of the following is a benefit of continuous integration?
Rapid feedback: When a build is executed, the team members are immediately notified about the builds status
Reduced risk: By integrating many times a day, you can reduce the risks in your project
Building of deployable software: The build process should generate software that can be deployed
All of the above #

# Question 6
OpenShift has built-in support for Jenkins CI server, a popular tool used in the CI/CD for automation of builds.
TRUE #
FALSE

# Question 7
Which of the following statements refers to S2I builds?
Invokes a Docker build, and expects a repository with a Dockerfile and additional sources required to build the image
Suitable for deploying an existing container image
Builds a new image out of a base image and the provided repository's source code #
Modifies an existing image to contain new RPMs

# Question 8
What is the role of triggers in a build configuration?
Define components that need to be triggered to start the build, for example, duplicators
Specify events for invoking builds, for example when a newer base image is available #
Describe the ImageStream resource to be created to support a built application
Define how many replicas should exist for a pod

# Question 9
To start an S2I build, you must specify the following:
A container file
A Git repository URL
A builder image
A Git repository URL and a builder image #

# Question 10
Which command ultimately creates a BuildConfig object?
oc start-build
oc new-app ##
oc adm new-project
docker build

# Question 11
A BuildConfig defines which of the following?
A service and a route for your application
A replication controller
Triggers to start a new build process and deployment #
All of the above

# Question 12
OpenShift administrators and/or users MUST create their own base/builder images to use with the S2I process.
TRUE
FALSE #

# Question 13
OpenShift can run images from any container registry, including which of the following?
Red Hat Container Catalog
Private container registries
OpenShift internal container registry
All of the above #

# Question 14
What is the role of the registry?
Ingress point for traffic destined for OpenShift services
Locally stores and manages access to container images #
Provides abstraction for accessing members of a logical set of pods
Matches FQDN-destined traffic requests to services and the pods they represent

# Question 15
Image streams can be used to automatically perform an action when new images are created. Builds and deployments can watch an image stream to receive notifications when new images are added, and react by performing a build or deployment.
TRUE #
FALSE

# Question 16
Which of the following are true?
OpenShift DeploymentConfigs are basically functional equivalents of Kubernetes deployments
OpenShift replication controllers are the functionally equivalents of Kubernetes Replica Sets
Kubernetes deployments and replica sets are available in OpenShift
All of the above #
