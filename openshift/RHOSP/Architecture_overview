# Question 1
OpenShift 4 master nodes are only supported to run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. Worker nodes run any environment that Red Hat Enterprise Linux runs on.
TRUE #
FALSE

# Question 2
Application instances and components run in containers--with many containers per OpenShift node.
TRUE #
FALSE

# Question 3
Which of the following is NOT true about pods?
They manage a group of a container's shared resources 
They are permanent, long term datastores #
OpenShift schedules deployment of containers by pods
They allow for individual application components to be easily scaled horizontally

# Question 4
Services define a logical set of pods and connect application components together.
TRUE #
FALSE

# Question 5
Labels are very important in OpenShift. Which of the following statements are NOT true about labels?
Labels are used to organize, group, or select API objects
Most objects can include labels in metadata
Labels are simple key-value pairs that you choose
Labels can never be changed #

# Question 6
The OpenShift master host is the API endpoint and the orchestrator of the system.
TRUE #      
FALSE

# Question 7
What is the purpose of 'etcd'?
Distributed key-value datastore for cluster state, RBAC rules, application environment information, etc. #
Responsible for determining pod placement
Stores and manages container images
Allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple platforms using a single API specification

# Question 8
What is the purpose of the scheduler?
Distributed key-value datastore for cluster state, RBAC rules, application environment information, etc.
Responsible for determining pod placement #
Stores and manages container images
Allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple platforms using a single API specification

# Question 9
What is the purpose of the registry?
Distributed key-value datastore for cluster state, RBAC rules, application environment information, etc.
Responsible for determining pod placement.
Stores and manages container images #
Allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple platforms using a single API specification

# Question 10
Which of the following is NOT true about Operators?
They are Kubernetes native applications
Administration, shell scripts, and automation software (like Ansible) are now in Kubernetes pods
They integratate natively with Kubernetes concepts and APIs
They are only written and provided by Red Hat, not the ISV community #

# Question 11
What is the purpose of the OpenShift router (aka Ingress Controller)?
Provides external access to applications deployed on OpenShift #
Ensures that the specified number of pod replicas run at all times
Provides a platform-wide, pluggable routing tier to route traffic to applications
Monitors application health via user-defined pod probes for liveness and readiness and can scale out pods based on CPU utilization metrics

# Question 12
The replication controller does which of the following?
Provides external access to applications deployed on OpenShift
Ensures that the specified number of pod replicas run at all times #
Provides a platform-wide, pluggable routing tier to route traffic to applications
Monitors application health via user-defined pod probes for liveness and readiness and can scale out pods based on CPU utilization metrics

# Question 13
The OpenShift networking SDN is capable of which of the following?
Provides external access to applications deployed on OpenShift
Ensures that the specified number of pod replicas run at all times
Provides a platform-wide, pluggable routing tier to route traffic to applications #
Monitors application health via user-defined pod probes for liveness and readiness and can scale out pods based on CPU utilization metrics

# Question 14
Which of the following tasks is handled by the OpenShift master?
Provides external access to applications deployed on OpenShift
Ensures that specified number of pod replicas running at all times
Provides a platform-wide, pluggable routing tier to route traffic to applications
Monitors application health via user-defined pod probes for liveness and readiness and can scale out pods based on CPU utilization metrics. #

# Question 15
A route object consists of a host name, a route name, a service selector, and optional security configurations. An OpenShift router consumes routes and is a deployment of one or more pods that forwards network traffic to the proper pods.
TRUE #
FALSE
