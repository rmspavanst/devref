7. Verify the permissions for the daniel user.
    Log in to the automation controller web UI as daniel with redhat123 as the password.
    Navigate to Access → Teams and then click the link for the Developers team.
    Notice that the Edit button is available, indicating that the daniel user can make changes to the Developers team.
    Click the Access tab.
    Notice that the Add button is available and that each existing role assignment for members of the Developers team contains an X, indicating that the role assignment can be removed. The daniel user can manage permissions for the Developers team. Having the Admin role additionally allows the daniel user to inherit permissions assigned to the Developers team.
    Click daniel → Logout to exit the automation controller web UI.

8. Verify the permissions for the donnie user.
    Log in to the automation controller web UI as donnie with redhat123 as the password.

    Click the Access tab.
    Notice that the Add button is not available and that each existing role assignment does not contain an X, indicating that the role assignment cannot be removed. The donnie user can view information about the Developers team, but the user cannot make changes to it. Additionally, by only having the Read role, the donnie user does not inherit permissions assigned to the Developers team.
    Click donnie → Logout to exit the automation controller web UI.

9. Verify the permissions for the david user.
    Log in to the automation controller web UI as david with redhat123 as the password.
    Navigate to Access → Teams and then click the link for the Developers team.
    Click the Access tab.
    Notice that the Add button is not available and that each existing role assignment does not contain an X, indicating that the role assignment cannot be removed. Like the donnie user, the david user can view information about the Developers team, but the user cannot make changes to it. Unlike the donnie user, having the Member role allows the david user to inherit permissions assigned to the Developers team.
